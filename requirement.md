**Non-Functional Requirements:**

* **Performance:** System should handle up to 1000 active users simultaneously.

* **Security:**

  * Authentication and authorization for all users.

  * Role-based access control.

  * OAuth for GitHub integration.

* **Usability:**

  * Intuitive UI/UX design.

  * Responsive design for mobile and desktop.

* **Scalability:**

  * Modular design to support feature expansion.

* **Availability:**

  * 99.9% uptime.

  * Regular backups and disaster recovery procedures.

---

**Future Enhancements (Optional):**

* Email/Slack notifications for ticket updates.

* Sprint velocity and burndown charts.

* Support for other version control systems (GitLab, Bitbucket).

* Integration with calendar tools for sprint planning.
